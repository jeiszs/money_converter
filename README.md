Why did I go about such a long way?

1. I forgot that #include \<cmath> existed for a moment (about 3 hours of gripping my hair in frustration).
2. This is my first time learning C++, although I've had background knowledge on coding (around 2 years now).
3. Assuming it's the reason that I forgot #include \<cmath> in my code, I was unable to use the module (%) operator, telling me that I had "invalid operands to binary..."
  blah blah blah. I decided to go around this.
4. Since this is my first time using C++, I had to use what I currently know from previous coding experience to compensate for my lack of syntax knowledge. Although it
  did greatly help that I've coded in Java for my AP CSA.
  

That's all! I'll probably post some of my projects that I've done along the way (which will mostly be in Python but once I learn more of C++'s syntax, I'll
  definitely create more - which, again, will most likely be adventure games).
  

See ya!
